    <p>Though there are over 20 different forms of photography there is one that stands out.This specific type stands out due to people becoming more environmentally aware.The beauty of our planet has been overlooked for the longest time,however nature photography helps to bring awareness to its beauty and brings our humanity back as humans.This we can say for certain because as a wildlife photographer the photographers get to see the love a mother may show her young cub or see how the animals we feed from not only take from the earth but also have a great role to play in what is given back to our beautiful earth. This field carries many categories,however continuing with the topic of Nature photography the main ones that will be highlighted are as listed below.

    <h3><b><center>Landscape Photography:<center></b></h3>
    <p>This type of photography shows spaces within the world,some vast and others
      microscopic.Though it typically focuses on the presence of nature it can also feature disturbances in the landscape that is man made. Many of the landscape photography we see today show wide fields of flowers or beautiful views of mountains such as the beautiful high view from Table Mountain located in Cape Town,Africa. However subjects can vary,as it can include single focused shots of the land,sky and the oceans waters. For example we look at the ones taken by top landscape photographers Cath Simard and Rachael Talibart. Firstly we see Cath Simard's photo which features her taking a photograph from a cave perspective which perfectly depicts the night sky decorated with the Northern Lights in Stokksnes,Ireland. As well as photos similar to that of Rachael Talibart of one main focus which,in this case, is a gigantic wave located on the coast of Britain. Looking farther down you will see 3 more beautiful photographs taken by top female landscape photographers.

    <h3><b><center>Wildlife Photography:</b><center></h3>
    <p>Wildlife is a form of photography that has the primary focus of documenting different forms of wildlife in their natural habitats. This special form of photography requires a photographer to have craft skills to keep themselves well hidden so they do not disturb the animals in their natural habitats and to prevent any disruptions that can cause any change to the animals daily habits.
      <p><b><i>e.g. Camouflage</i></b></p>

      <p>We know wildlife photography to be a very popular form of nature photography. This field ranges from photos we take at our natural wildlife parks to the extremely popular organizations such as National Geographic Society which is a global not-profit organization that releases the most read magazine called National Geographic which contains photojournalism,wildlife photography and other types of photography.</p>
        <center><img src="https://dcmp.org/producer_images/national-geographic-hero.jpg" alt="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdcmp.org%2Fproducers%2F192-national-geographic-society&psig=AOvVaw0_FfRtT8G8chDEFoteZWON&ust=1633683262766000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAsQjRxqFwoTCMDVvtP2t_MCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD" width="1720" height="404"></center><p>What separates those who take photos mainly when they go on vacation and those who spend hours trying to get the perfect shot would be the equipment,time and effort put into taking the photo and editing it. This is especially evident in wildlife photography because the goal is to get the perfect shot without disturbing the animals in their habitats.Beautiful results can arise from such stealthiness,such as the ones shown below. All photos taken in wildlife show different elements of nature,many either envoking a humerous,captivated and saddening emotion in us or leaving us with a soft spot in our hearts for that  species.Either way,such perspectives only add to the fields diversity.
